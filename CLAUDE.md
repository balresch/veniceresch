# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A typed, async-first Python client for the Venice.ai API. Venice publishes no official Python SDK but does maintain an OpenAPI 3.0 spec at `github.com/veniceai/api-docs/blob/main/swagger.yaml` — that spec is the source of truth for types.

`CHANGELOG.md` tracks what shipped per release.

## Architecture — the split that matters

Two distinct layers; they must stay distinct:

1. **`src/veniceresch/_generated.py`** — auto-generated from `vendor/venice-swagger.yaml` by `datamodel-code-generator`. **Never hand-edit.** Regenerate via `bash scripts/regen_types.sh [--offline]`. Committed so installs don't need the generator. mypy/ruff ignore it.
2. **Hand-written thin layer**:
   - `_client.py` — `AsyncVeniceClient` + `VeniceClient` (httpx wrapper). Both own their httpx session by default; callers can inject one for reuse. Internal helpers: `_request_json` (JSON in/out), `_request_any` (arrays), `_request_bytes` (binary responses), `_request_stream` (SSE / streaming). `_request_json` / `_send` take `no_auth=True` to strip the default `Authorization: Bearer …` for endpoints that use another auth scheme (x402 SIWE, `/api_keys/generate_web3_key`).
   - `_errors.py` — typed exception hierarchy. `raise_for_response()` maps non-2xx responses. Content-violation detection by body shape (`suggested_prompt`), not status, because Venice has used both 400 and 422 for them. A 402 whose body carries `x402Version` + `accepts` is surfaced as `VeniceX402PaymentRequiredError` (not `VeniceInsufficientBalanceError`) — that body is the x402 discovery payload, not an error. `translate_httpx_error()` wraps transport-level httpx errors as `VeniceConnectionError` / `VeniceTimeoutError`.
   - `_base_model.py` — `VeniceBaseModel` with `ConfigDict(extra="allow")`; the shared base for every Pydantic model (both generated and hand-written). Unknown fields land on `.model_extra` instead of raising.
   - `types.py` — re-exports generated response models plus hand-authored ones for endpoints whose swagger response is inline (no named schema).
   - `pagination.py` — `AsyncPaginator` / `Paginator` generic classes. Endpoint-agnostic: each `iter_*` resource method passes three closures (fetch / extract items / compute next params or None). Lazy — no HTTP until `async for` / `for` starts. `__aiter__` / `__iter__` yield items; `.iter_pages()` yields pages.
   - `resources/*.py` — one module per endpoint group. Each method maps swagger `requestBody.properties` to kwargs, calls the client helper, returns a typed Pydantic model or raw `bytes`. Resources don't construct httpx requests directly.

`client.chat`, `client.responses`, `client.image`, `client.images` (OpenAI alias), `client.video`, `client.audio`, `client.models`, `client.embeddings`, `client.billing`, `client.augment`, `client.characters`, `client.api_keys`, `client.x402`, `client.crypto` are wired in both client constructors. `client.chat.completions` is an OpenAI-namespace alias for `client.chat`.

## Non-goals

- **No retry/backoff logic.** The SDK only raises typed exceptions so callers can dispatch and plug in their own retry policy.
- **No CLI.** Library only.
- **No SSE parsers beyond plain dict events.** `resources/_sse.py` stops at `[DONE]` and yields decoded JSON (wrapped into `ChatCompletionChunk` at the chat resource layer).

## Venice-specific ergonomics

- **`venice_parameters`** — Venice extends chat completions with an extras object. First-class kwarg in `chat.create` / `chat.stream`.
- **Binary responses** — image edit/multi-edit/upscale/background-remove return raw PNG bytes. Resource methods return `bytes`. For image-generate, `generate()` returns a `GenerateImageResponse` (JSON) and `generate_binary()` returns bytes (forces `return_binary=True`).
- **Video polling** — `/video/queue` gives a `queue_id`; caller polls `/video/retrieve` until `status != "PROCESSING"`. The `wait_for_completion(queue_id, model, timeout_s, poll_interval_s)` helper is the only resource method with real logic beyond "post and parse." Raises `VeniceVideoTimeoutError` on deadline. Audio has the same pattern. Queue/retrieve/quote/complete/transcribe methods return hand-authored Pydantic wrappers (`VideoQueueResponse`, `AudioRetrieveResponse`, …), not `dict`.
- **`model_id` vs `model`** — `/image/multi-edit` uses `modelId` (camelCase) in the spec; the Python API accepts `model_id` and translates. Everywhere else it's `model`.
- **Binary Accept header** — `_request_bytes` sets `Accept: application/octet-stream` by default, but caller-provided `headers={"Accept": ...}` wins. Needed for `video/mp4`, `audio/mpeg`, etc.
- **Streaming await contract** — `await client.chat.stream(...)` or `await client.chat.create(..., stream=True)` returns an async iterator; then `async for` it. Both async forms require the `await` (same shape as the OpenAI Python SDK). Sync streaming returns an iterator directly.
- **BYO-header auth for `/api_keys/generate_web3_key` + `/x402/*`** — these routes use wallet signatures (SIWE) or signed x402 payment payloads, not bearer tokens. The resources accept the header values as plain strings (`siwx_header=`, `payment_header=`) and send them verbatim with `no_auth=True` so the default bearer is stripped. We don't bundle a web3 signer; callers produce the signed payloads with their own tooling. The canonical wallet-auth header is now `SIGN-IN-WITH-X` (used by the newer `/crypto/rpc/{network}` and `/audio/voices` routes, which accept *either* bearer or wallet auth); `/x402/*` still sends the legacy `X-Sign-In-With-X` header, which Venice continues to accept.
- **Crypto JSON-RPC proxy (`client.crypto`)** — `networks()` is public (`no_auth=True`, no key needed at the wire level). `rpc(network, request, …)` proxies a single JSON-RPC object or a batch list and returns the decoded JSON verbatim (`dict` or `list`) via `_request_any` — there's no typed wrapper for the RPC payload because its shape is method-dependent. Per-request JSON-RPC failures are HTTP 200 with an `error` field, not exceptions.
- **x402 top-up discovery flow** — `POST /x402/top-up` returns 402 by design when called without a payment header; that body (`x402Version` + `accepts`) is surfaced as `VeniceX402PaymentRequiredError`, not an error condition. One method (`x402.top_up`) covers both the discovery and the signed-payment flows.
- **Auto-pagination helpers** — four list endpoints (`x402.transactions`, `characters.list`, `characters.reviews`, `billing.usage`) ship companion `iter_*` methods (`iter_transactions`, `iter_list`, `iter_reviews`, `iter_usage`) that return an `AsyncPaginator` / `Paginator` and walk every page automatically. Items are `dict[str, Any]` by drift-tolerance convention (same as the single-page wrappers). The single-page methods keep working unchanged; `iter_*` is purely additive. End-of-data is detected per endpoint: `hasMore=False` (x402), `page >= totalPages` (characters.reviews, billing.usage), or a short page (characters.list, which has no envelope). `api_keys.rate_limits_log` is **not** paginated (swagger fixes it at last-50) so it has no `iter_*` counterpart.

## Response-model strategy

Hand-authored wrappers in `types.py` (`ModelList`, `ChatCompletionResponse`, etc.) use `list[dict[str, Any]]` for nested collections rather than strict generated types. Pydantic validates recursively, so nesting a strict schema inside a tolerant wrapper reintroduces validation fragility. Callers who need the typed nested form parse an element explicitly: `ModelResponse.model_validate(result.data[0])`.

Generated response types used directly by resources (`BillingBalanceResponse`, `ResponsesResponse`, …) use `Cls.model_construct(**raw)` rather than `model_validate` — skipping strict schema validation — so missing/renamed required fields in Venice's responses won't break the client.

## Commands

- Regenerate types: `bash scripts/regen_types.sh` (fetches latest swagger) or `--offline` (uses pinned `vendor/venice-swagger.yaml`). `--base-class veniceresch._base_model.VeniceBaseModel` is already wired in.
- Lint/format: `ruff check .` / `ruff format .`
- Type check: `mypy src/veniceresch` (strict, excludes `_generated.py`)
- Unit tests (offline, respx-mocked): `pytest` — integration tests are excluded by default via `addopts --ignore=tests/integration`.
- Integration smoke (hits real API): `VENICE_API_KEY=... pytest tests/integration -m integration`
- Single test: `pytest tests/test_chat.py::test_name`
- Install in editable mode: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`

## Endpoint coverage

Covered (44 of 44 paths): chat (1), responses (1), image (6), images (1, OpenAI alias for `/images/generations`), video (5), audio (7 — incl. `/audio/voices` voice cloning), models (3), embeddings (1), billing (3), augment (3), characters (3), api_keys (5), x402 (3), crypto (2 — `/crypto/rpc/networks` + `/crypto/rpc/{network}` JSON-RPC proxy). `/chat/completions` and `/responses` both support SSE streaming. See `CHANGELOG.md` and the coverage table in `README.md` for the full list.

## Python / packaging

- Python floor: **3.10+** (PEP 604 `X | Y` unions; `typing_extensions.Self` because `typing.Self` is 3.11+).
- Build backend: `hatchling`. PyPI name: `veniceresch`. Import: `veniceresch`.
- mypy is strict on hand-written code; `_generated.py` is explicitly excluded.
